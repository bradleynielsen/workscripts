what this does:
• unzips any number of zip files
• renames them to combine the folder name and the plugin name
• moves all files into one folder called 'emasster'



move zip files containing .nessus files into this folder containing "emassterinit.ps1" 
run emassterinit.ps1
unzipped and renamed files will be in 'emasster' folder
